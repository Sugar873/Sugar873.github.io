Hi, I'm Sagar Syal, a Computer Systems Engineer with a passion for robotics, machine learning, and embedded systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Carleton University and have hands-on experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Romaeris and as a Tutor at Oxford Learning Kanata.

At Romaeris, I enhanced drone operations by developing an advanced error handling system, contributed to software testing for mapping tools, and automated drone data processes. Additionally, I have worked on notable projects such as a surgical robotics project using a Meca500 robot for laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) and an autonomous car navigation project focused on real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance.

I am proficient in programming languages like C#, Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript, and skilled with frameworks and tools such as Microsoft .NET, Bootstrap, VS Code, GIT, Jira, and the Robot Operating System (ROS). I also have experience with operating systems including Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android.

I am proficient in Python, C++, and Java, and comfortable with many other programming languages as well. I have extensive experience with frameworks and tools such as Microsoft .NET, Bootstrap, VS Code, GIT, Jira, and ROS. Additionally, I have experience in machine learning packages like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and am familiar with operating systems such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android.

My enthusiasm for robotics and machine learning drives me to explore new technologies in these fields. I am currently expanding my knowledge in robotic vision, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with technological advancements.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy practicing Judo, in which I hold a blue belt, as well as free style wrestling. I love staying active, reading comics, and playing video games.
