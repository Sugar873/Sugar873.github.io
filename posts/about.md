Hi, I’m Sagar Syal, a Computer Systems Engineer with a passion for robotics, machine learning, and embedded systems. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Carleton University and have hands-on experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Romaeris.

I’m currently exploring new technologies in:

- Robotic vision
- Data analytics
- Artificial intelligence
- Computer security
- Surgical Robotics

I have been involved in several notable projects, including:

- **Dynamic Trajectory Generation for LPD Surgery**: Developed trajectory generation and computer vision algorithms using a Meca500 robot for laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) surgery
- **Autonomous Car Navigation Project**: Focused on real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance

I love seeing my code have a real positive impact and enjoy staying updated with technological advancements. If you’d like to know more about my projects or my experience, please check out the Projects section or the Work Experience tab.

When I’m not coding, you can find me practicing Judo where I hold a blue belt, freestyle wrestling, staying active, reading comics, or playing video games.
